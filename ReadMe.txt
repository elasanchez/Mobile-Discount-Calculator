Readme

The program utilizes singleton design pattern where it uses a model called
dcModel and its data can be accessed by multiple view controller. 
The view controller can then use these data to represent to the UI View.

The program works as intended where it takes inputs and calculates the
discounted price. The UI view displays the Original Price and Discounted Price.

When swiping left and right, it changes from the menu to the summary or result view where it displays a visual representation of the original and discounted prices. The shape of the graph reflects the change in the numeric output.
